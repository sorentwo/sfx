An AS3 animation library with pre-defined effects, queues and tweening.

The current version has a rather generic syntax and is entirely OO, goals for the next version include:

  * Mirror the jQuery animate() API
  * Add support for infinite chaining
  * Implement functional programming callbacks
  * Some actual testing
